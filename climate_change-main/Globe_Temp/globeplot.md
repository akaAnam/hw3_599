# 3-Dimensional Globe Plot


The globe plot visualization displays the maximum change in temperature in the last three hundred years for over a hundred cities across the globe. The plot was built using threejs, and allows the end-user to swivel, zoom, and pan across the globe at will to investigate the change in temperature by city. The three-dimensional nature of the globe allows the end-user to see the impacts of climate change at the scale theyâ€™re most interested in. The globejs function from threejs allows easy, repeatable three-dimensional plotting of any value given that a dataset contains a accompanying latitude, longitude, and value object for the plot they wish to create.
